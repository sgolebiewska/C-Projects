# Univeristy Projects (ideas: Gda≈Ñsk Technical University)
<br/> 
* Object Oriented 2D Game
This project focuses on creating a 2D virtual world simulator with the primary objective of implementing a grid structure of dimensions NxM. <br/> 
The virtual environment will host diverse life forms, each exhibiting distinct behaviors based on their species. <br/> 
Every organism is designated to occupy a specific cell within the 2D grid array, ensuring that each cell accommodates only one organism at a time. <br/> 
In the event of a collision, the system will handle the removal of one of the organisms from the affected cell.<br/> 
This project was implemented in C++ as well as in Java.<br/> 
<br/> 
* CSS parser
<br/> 
The goal of the task is to create a simple engine for processing CSS. <br/> 
As part of the task, it was needed to read sections of CSS interleaved with command sections from the standard input. <br/> 
Parse the CSS sections and place them in the appropriate structures. <br/> 
Parse the command sections and execute them, printing any results to the standard output (if any, after ==).<br/>
