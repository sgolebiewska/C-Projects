Object Oriented Game
This project focuses on creating a 2D virtual world simulator with the primary objective of implementing a grid structure of dimensions NxM. 
The virtual environment will host diverse life forms, each exhibiting distinct behaviors based on their species. 
Every organism is designated to occupy a specific cell within the 2D grid array, ensuring that each cell accommodates only one organism at a time. 
In the event of a collision, the system will handle the removal of one of the organisms from the affected cell.
